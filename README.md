# Implementation

## Overview

The "water" framework is designed to be a modular and extensible platform for building applications in both OSGi and Spring environments. It provides a foundation for creating, managing, and discovering components and services. The framework offers features such as interceptors, component filtering, property management, security, and testing, which can be used to customize service behavior and add cross-cutting concerns.

This repository, "Implementation," contains the concrete implementation of the core "water" framework. It provides the building blocks for creating applications using the framework. The modules within this repository offer specific functionalities that support the framework's overall goals. These modules include:

- **Core Modules:** Define the essential interfaces, abstractions, and models used throughout the framework.
- **OSGi Modules:** Implement the framework's features within an OSGi environment, including component registration, service interception, and property management.
- **Spring Modules:** Implement the framework's features within a Spring environment, providing similar functionalities as the OSGi modules but adapted for the Spring ecosystem.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a reusable and extensible implementation of the "water" framework that can be easily integrated into various application environments. It enables developers to build modular, service-oriented applications with consistent behavior and cross-cutting concerns.

### Module Usage

#### Core Modules

The core modules (Core-api, Core-bundle, Core-interceptors, Core-model, Core-permission, Core-registry, Core-security, Core-service, Core-validation) define the fundamental interfaces, abstractions, and data models used throughout the "water" framework. These modules are typically added as dependencies to other modules or projects that need to use the framework's core functionalities. To use a core module, add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'it.water.core', name: 'Core-api', version: project.waterVersion
}
```

#### OSGi Module (Implementation-osgi)

The `Implementation-osgi` module provides the OSGi-specific implementation of the "water" framework. It includes components such as `OsgiApplicationProperties`, `OsgiComponentRegistry`, and `ServiceHooks`, which are used to manage components, properties, and services within an OSGi environment. To use this module, you can deploy it as an OSGi bundle in a compatible runtime container such as Apache Karaf.

To integrate the OSGi module, ensure your OSGi environment is set up correctly. This typically involves installing an OSGi container like Apache Karaf, and then deploying the `Implementation-osgi` bundle into the container. The bundle will then automatically register the necessary services and components within the OSGi environment.

#### Spring Module (Implementation-spring)

The `Implementation-spring` module provides the Spring-specific implementation of the "water" framework. It includes components such as `SpringApplicationProperties`, `SpringComponentRegistry`, and `SpringServiceInterceptor`, which are used to manage components, properties, and services within a Spring environment. To use this module, you can add the `@EnableWaterFramework` annotation to your Spring application's configuration class.

To integrate the Spring module, add the necessary dependencies to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'it.water.core', name: 'Core-api', version: project.waterVersion
    implementation group: 'it.water.core', name: 'Core-bundle', version: project.waterVersion
    implementation group: 'org.springframework.boot', name:'spring-boot-starter-aop', version: project.springBootVersion
}
```

Then, annotate your main application class with `@EnableWaterFramework`:

```java
import it.water.implementation.spring.annotations.EnableWaterFramework;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableWaterFramework
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This annotation imports the `WaterSpringConfiguration`, which sets up the necessary beans and configurations for the "water" framework to work within your Spring application.

## Functional Analysis

### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The primary responsibilities of the "water" framework are:

-   **Component Management:** Providing a registry for managing the lifecycle of components (OsgiComponentRegistry and SpringComponentRegistry). This includes registering, discovering, and unregistering components.
-   **Service Interception:** Intercepting service invocations to add cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and validation (OsgiServiceInterceptor and SpringServiceInterceptor).
-   **Property Management:** Managing application properties in both OSGi and Spring environments (OsgiApplicationProperties and SpringApplicationProperties).
-   **Security Context:** Providing a security context for components to make authorization decisions (OsgiSecurityContext and SpringSecurityContext).
-   **Extensibility:** Providing a modular and extensible architecture that allows developers to add new components, services, and interceptors.

### 2. Problems the System Solves

The "water" framework addresses the following problems:

-   **Modularity:** It provides a modular architecture that allows developers to separate concerns and build reusable components.
-   **Service-Oriented Architecture:** It promotes a service-oriented approach, making it easier to build and consume services.
-   **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** It provides a mechanism for adding cross-cutting concerns to services without modifying the service code.
-   **Configuration Management:** It simplifies the management of application properties in different environments.
-   **Security:** It provides a security context for components to make authorization decisions.

### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The modules and components in the "water" framework interact as follows:

-   **Component Registration:** Components are registered with the component registry (OsgiComponentRegistry or SpringComponentRegistry), which manages their lifecycle and makes them available for discovery.
-   **Service Interception:** ServiceHooks (OSGi) and SpringServiceInterceptor intercept service invocations, allowing for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and validation to be added.
-   **Component Discovery:** Components can be discovered using the component registry's `findComponent` and `findComponents` methods, which support filtering based on component properties.
-   **Property Management:** Application properties are managed by OsgiApplicationProperties (OSGi) and SpringApplicationProperties (Spring), providing a centralized way to access configuration values.
-   **Security:** OsgiSecurityContext and SpringSecurityContext provide security context information, allowing components to make authorization decisions.

The dependency flow is generally from the core modules to the OSGi and Spring modules. The OSGi and Spring modules depend on the core modules for their interfaces and abstractions.

### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

The "water" framework primarily provides system-facing functionalities. It is a framework for building applications, rather than an end-user application. The framework provides the following system-facing functionalities:

-   **Component Registration and Discovery:** Allows developers to register and discover components and services.
-   **Service Interception:** Allows developers to add cross-cutting concerns to services.
-   **Property Management:** Allows developers to manage application properties.
-   **Security Context:** Allows components to make authorization decisions.

These functionalities are used by developers to build applications that meet specific user needs.

The `it.water.core.api.service.Service` interface serves as a base interface for services within the framework. Classes implementing this interface are expected to be managed by the component registry and may be subject to service interception.

## Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

-   **Modular Design:** The framework is designed with a modular architecture, using OSGi bundles and Spring modules to separate concerns and promote reusability.
-   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** The framework promotes a service-oriented approach, with components exposing services that can be consumed by other components.
-   **Inversion of Control (IoC):** The framework uses IoC to decouple components and make them more testable.
-   **Proxy Pattern:** The framework uses proxies to intercept service invocations and add custom behavior.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The framework is based on a component-based architecture, where components are the building blocks of applications.
-   **Extensibility:** The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add new components, services, and interceptors.
-   **Design Patterns:** Several design patterns are used throughout the framework, including Singleton, Factory, and Proxy.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The Core-permission module suggests the presence of RBAC, though the details of its implementation are not fully evident from the provided files.
